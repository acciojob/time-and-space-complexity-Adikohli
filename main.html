	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a vital concept in computer science and algorithm design. It quantifies the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its running time scales with the size of the input data. In essence, time complexity provides us with a measure of an algorithm's efficiency, helping us assess its practical utility for solving problems. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient because they can process larger datasets or perform operations in less time compared to those with higher time complexity. This understanding of time complexity is indispensable for making informed decisions when selecting or designing algorithms to ensure optimal performance in various computing tasks.</p>
	<p><b>Certainly, here's a paragraph explaining space complexity using the keywords "Space Complexity" and "O(n)":
"Space complexity, a critical concept in algorithm analysis, refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to perform a given task in relation to the size of the input data. It is denoted by the notation 'O(n),' where 'n' represents the size of the input. In simpler terms, space complexity helps us understand how an algorithm's memory usage scales with the size of the problem it's solving. Algorithms with a space complexity of O(n) utilize a space that is directly proportional to the input size. Managing space efficiently is essential, especially in scenarios where memory resources are limited, making space complexity analysis a crucial factor when designing and selecting algorithms."</b></p>
